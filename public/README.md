# CryptoF1FantasyLeague


<h2>About Us</h2>
Being fanatics of the motorsport industry, we have always wondered what it is like to manage a real-world F1 team and the triumph that comes from race wins. However, the current F1 fantasy league proves to be inadequate in fulfilling these needs. The penalties and demerit points that follow the individual after a lost will drastically derail any significant progress in becoming the champion. In the long run, one will feel increasingly distant from the sport due to feeling of frustration and contempt.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, we decided to start our own F1 Crypto Fantasy league, where said penalties and demerit points will not as hefty as the original - instead, we offer players an opportunity to purchase drivers/teams packs that will allow them to recurperate any significant loses in the following race weekends. Moreover, to drive continuous participation from the players, we offer crypto payouts as a form of incentive. This aids in retaining and expanding our player base as one is able to relieve the true experience as a team manager whilst earning substantial rewards.
